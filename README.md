ASSUMPTIONS. This analyzer is optimized for use with MP4 or MOV files with the following constraints:
  1. vital labeling of cells with fluorescent IB4 lectin
  2. 20x objective
  3. 90 second interval

SAMPLE VIDEOS (from Carbonell et al., 2005b). 
  1. MOVIE1_TEST.MOV - thalamus 24h after lesion (inflammatory condition)
  2. MOVIE2_TEST.MOV - thalamus 24h after sham lesion (naive control)
